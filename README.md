# EgyptTourGuide-website
A single-page website created for Egyptian tour guide based in Luxor


////////////////// Description
Single-page website made for Egyptian Tour Guide named Hassan.
Main goal was to create clear site showing possible tours and showing Hassan capabilities as tour (especially in terms of building trust)
Due to Egyptian internet limitations additional goal was to minimise page weight. That resulted in use of CSS/JS with no additional frontend libs
